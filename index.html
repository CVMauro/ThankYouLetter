  <Title>Thank You Sam!</Title>

  <!-- If you're reading this Sam, congrats!? I'm not sure why you'd be looking at the code, but thanks! -->

  <h1>Welcome Sam!</h1>
  <p>I'm by no means a skilled writer, so I decided to return your kindness in one of the only ways I know how: coding! This is one of the only websites I've ever made, so if there are any problems with displaying this, ദ്ദി •⩊• ) good luck!</p>
  <p>The second part of my letter will be a video, so I hope you enjoy it. I also attached something special at the end of the page, which I will talk about in the video.</p>
